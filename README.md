1. Write an application that will calculate and output the value according to the formula:
a=4*(b+c-1)/ 2; we set b and c in the code ourselves.

2. A two-digit number is stored in the variable n. Create a program that calculates and
displays the sum of the digits n. For example: n =26, as a result we should get 8
(2+6).

3. The variable n stores a three-digit number. Create a program that calculates and
displays the sum of the digits n. For example: n =126, as a result we should get
9 (1+2+6).

4. The variable n stores a real number with a non-zero fractional part. Create
a program that rounds the number n to the nearest integer and displays the result on
the screen.

5. The variables q and w store two natural numbers. Create a program
that displays the result of dividing q by w with the remainder. An example of program output (for the case
when q stores 21 and w stores 8): 21/8 = 2 and 5 in the remainder.

6.* Write a program that will swap the values of integer
variables. Example:
int a = 1; int b = 2;
//code (your solution)
sout(a); //outputs 2
sout(b); //outputs 1
To improve the program, use only 2 input variables (a,b).
